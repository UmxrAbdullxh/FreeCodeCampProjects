      <h1 id = "title"> John Forbes Nash Jr.</h1>
      <p>He was an American mathematician who made fundamental contributions to game theory, differential geometry, and the study of partial differential equations.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Nash was born on June 13, 1928, in Bluefield, West Virginia.</li>
          <li>He attended Carnegie Institute of Technology (which later became Carnegie Mellon University) </li>
          <li>He switched to a chemistry major and eventually, at the advice of his teacher John Lighton Synge, to mathematics.</li>
          <li> After graduating in 1948 (at age 19) with both a B.S. and M.S. in mathematics, Nash accepted a scholarship to Princeton University, where he pursued further graduate studies in mathematics.</li>
          <li>At Princeton, he began work on his equilibrium theory, later known as the Nash equilibrium.</li>
          <li>Nash earned a PhD in 1950 with a 28-page dissertation on non-cooperative games.</li>
          <li>The thesis, written under the supervision of doctoral advisor Albert W. Tucker, contained the definition and properties of the Nash equilibrium, a crucial concept in non-cooperative games. It won Nash the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1994. </li>
          <li>Nash did groundbreaking work in the area of real algebraic geometry. </li>
          <li>His work in mathematics includes the Nash embedding theorem, which shows that every abstract Riemannian manifold can be isometrically realized as a submanifold of Euclidean space. He also made significant contributions to the theory of nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations and to singularity theory.</li>
          <li>In 1978, Nash was awarded the John von Neumann Theory Prize for his discovery of non-cooperative equilibria, now called Nash Equilibria. He won the Leroy P. Steele Prize in 1999. </li>
        <li>On May 23, 2015, Nash and his wife, Alicia Nash, died in a car accident on the New Jersey Turnpike near Monroe Township, New Jersey.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov writes about Nash's work:</p>

<p id="tribute">Nash was solving classical mathematical problems, difficult problems, something that nobody else was able to do, not even to imagine how to do it. ... But what Nash discovered in the course of his constructions of isometric embeddings is far from 'classical' â€” it is something that brings about a dramatic alteration of our understanding of the basic logic of analysis and differential geometry. Judging from the classical perspective, what Nash has achieved in his papers is as impossible as the story of his life ... [H]is work on isometric immersions ... opened a new world of mathematics that stretches in front of our eyes in yet unknown directions and still waits to be explored.</p>
